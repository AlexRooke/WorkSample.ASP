# WorkSample.ASP
This is a code sample from my Bachelors Degree program. Utilizing ASP.NET and C#
from Visual Studio 2012 I created a TicTacToe game that uses cookies to pass memory 
from one players turn to the next. The 'win logic' checks the passed in moves and 
mathematically determins if a win situation has occured.
There is also logic that will check player moves to determin if they are legal. In 
the situation that a move is illegal, eg. taken position, the page reloads and 
requests the player to try another location.
